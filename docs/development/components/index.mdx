Components can be added and edited in the UI editor, see Altinn Studio Designer. Available settings are described for each component below.

When building an application, the layout of each page is described by a `{pageName}.json` file located in `{applicationRepo}/App/ui/layouts/`. Components added to the page are listed in the layout subsection in the file.

Available components and their respective properties are defined in each component’s JSON schema file.

Properties common to multiple components are described in a separate file and referenced by the component files. These properties are described separately in Common Component Properties below.
