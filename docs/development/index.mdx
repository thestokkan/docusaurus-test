# Development

You can develop services by using both Altinn Studio Designer and a local development environment. Here, we have gathered the information you need to create and edit digital services in Altinn Studio.

Are you new to Altinn Studio? We recommend that you start [here](../getting-started/).

## Keep up with new functionality in Altinn Studio

We continuously develop Altinn Studio in collaboration with service owners. Therefore, new functionality is regularly added. To keep up with the latest updates, you can join Altinn coffee once a month and follow the news on [this page](https://docs.altinn.studio/community/presentations/#themed-meetings).
