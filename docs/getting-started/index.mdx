Altinn Studio is a common tool for creating digital services that we call applications. An application can be both forms and more advanced services like "a specific example".

How you use Altinn Studio depends on your skills and preferences, and how complex the thing you are going to develop is. You can choose to create applications in Altinn Studio or in a local development environment.

In Altinn Studio Designer, you can create applications by using ready-made components. Creating the application in a local development environment requires some technical expertise. Many combine these approaches, using both Altinn Studio Designer and a local development environment.
